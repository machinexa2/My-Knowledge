# Kali Setup
## Description 
I lot of times format my PC due to error such as the safest command `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda` and other cmds. This is meant for instantly setting up everything so i dont have to **waste** my time.

## After Kali Installation
* `cat apt.data | bash`
* `cat pip.data | bash`
* `cat tool.data | bash`
